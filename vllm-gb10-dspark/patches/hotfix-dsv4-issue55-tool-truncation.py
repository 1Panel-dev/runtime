"""Issue #55 mitigation (recipe-side, no upstream vLLM change).

When ``max_tokens`` truncates a request mid-tool-call (engine finish_reason =
``FinishReason.LENGTH``), stock vLLM reports ``finish_reason="tool_calls"``
even though the call never completed, and the streaming flush path can hand
the client a ``tool_calls[].function.arguments`` that does **not** parse as
JSON. A harness that replays the broken call then sees the whole transcript
rejected with HTTP 400 ("Unterminated string …").

This hotfix makes two monotonically-safer edits to the chat-completions
serving path (both in
``vllm/entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/serving.py``):

1. **Streaming final chunk** — if the engine truncated for ``length``,
   report ``finish_reason="length"`` (not ``"tool_calls"``), and strip any
   non-JSON-parseable ``tool_calls`` from the trailing ``delta_message`` so
   invalid args are not flushed to the client. Natural-stop tool calls keep
   ``finish_reason="tool_calls"``.
2. **Non-streaming** — if the engine truncated for ``length``, do *not*
   claim ``finish_reason="tool_calls"`` and drop any unparseable
   ``message.tool_calls`` (defense-in-depth; the parser normally does not
   flush partial args in non-streaming mode, but this guarantees it).

The fix is gated entirely on the engine's own ``FinishReason.LENGTH`` signal
so a normal model-terminated tool call is unchanged.
