"""Hotfix: enforce SchedulerConfig.max_num_partial_prefills in the v1 scheduler.

Upstream vLLM 0.25.2.dev0 (ghcr.io/anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10:0.1.1) defines
``max_num_partial_prefills`` / ``max_long_partial_prefills`` on SchedulerConfig
but the v1 ``Scheduler.schedule`` admission loop never reads them — only
``max_num_seqs`` and ``token_budget`` gate new admissions. With chunked prefill
+ async scheduling + max_num_seqs>=8 and long_prefill_token_threshold=0
(default), multiple already-admitted-but-still-prefilling requests at the
front of ``self.running`` each consume up to ``max_num_batched_tokens`` per
step; decode-active requests later in the running list get
``num_new_tokens == 0`` and are skipped with ``continue`` (NOT preempted) —
producing severe, cold-only, zero-preemption decode lane starvation that
grows with prompt length. (Issue #27.)

Fix: at the top of the waiting-admission loop, break (don't admit a new
prefill request) once the number of in-flight partial prefills has reached
the cap. The cap is ``DSPARK_MAX_INFLIGHT_PREFILLS`` (1-3, default 2 via
compose) because this image rejects ``--max-num-partial-prefills``. It is
parsed once during ``Scheduler`` construction; unset, blank, nonpositive, or
malformed values fall back to ``SchedulerConfig.max_num_partial_prefills``
(stock 1), and malformed values emit one warning. ``self._inflight_prefills``
is maintained by ``_update_after_schedule`` (populated for requests still
needing more prefill chunks, discarded when they finish prefilling), so it
correctly reflects the currently-prefilling set. This restores the documented
concurrency cap of 1 by default, so at most one request prefill-chunks per
step and decode lanes behind it in ``self.running`` always receive budget
(chunk cap via ``--long-prefill-token-threshold`` keeps that one chunk below
``max_num_batched_tokens`` leaving room for decode tokens).

Idempotent: re-applying is a no-op once the marker is present.

Patches /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/vllm/v1/core/sched/scheduler.py
in-place inside the container (called from the compose entrypoint before
``exec vllm serve``).
