"""Hotfix (issue #43): bounded decode service during mixed prefill steps +
per-step scheduler diagnostics. Layers on top of the issue #27 hotfix
(``hotfix-dsv4-issue27-partial-prefill-concurrency.py``), which restored the
v1 scheduler's missing ``max_num_partial_prefills`` admission gate.

Why this exists (issue #43 follow-up)
-------------------------------------
The #27 fix caps concurrent in-flight prefills to ``max_num_partial_prefills``
(default 1) and ``--long-prefill-token-threshold`` caps each prefill chunk. It
cured the *per-step* decode starvation (worst ITL 2790 ms -> 67 ms) but the
reporter's six-cell cold retest still shows a wide *whole-request* decode-rate
spread (min/max 0.107-0.238). Issue #43 asks for:

  1. scheduled prefill/decode tokens per step and per request;
  2. zero-token decode skips by request and running-list position;
  3. bounded service for every decode-active request during mixed steps;
  4. per-lane p95 ITL and whole decode-window fairness (separate harness).

This hotfix delivers (1)-(3) inside the scheduler. (4) lives in
``scripts/reproduce-issue43-live.py``.)

What it changes (all in ``Scheduler.schedule``)
-----------------------------------------------
A. Bounded decode service (ask #3) -- the actual *fix*. While iterating the
   RUNNING list, when the current request is a prefill chunk, reserve one
   decode step's worth of token budget for every still-unvis ited,
   decode-active running request behind it, and cap the prefill chunk so that
   reservation is never violated. If the remaining budget can't satisfy both
   the prefill chunk and the decode reservation, the prefill chunk is dropped
   to 0 tokens and skipped (``continue``), letting the decode lanes run.
   This generalizes the #27 cap beyond ``max_num_partial_prefills=1``: it is
   a per-step, per-lane service floor that holds for any
   ``--long-prefill-token-threshold`` tuning, so mis-tuning the chunk cap can
   no longer resurrect #27-style decode skips. It is a no-op under the
   current default knob set (threshold=1024, budget=8192, cap=1), where the
   prefill chunk is already far below the decode reservation.

B. Zero-token decode-skip recording (ask #2). At the ``num_new_tokens == 0``
   skip branch, if the skipped request is decode-active (past its prompt and
   not at its async max-tokens sentinel), record
   ``(request_id, running_list_position, num_computed_tokens)``.

C. Per-request scheduled-token recording (ask #1). For every scheduled
   running request, record its scheduled token count keyed by request_id in
   ``self.issue43_last_step_diag["prefill"|"decode"]``. Decode-active requests
   land in ``"decode"``; prefill chunks land in ``"prefill"``.

D. Step summary log (ask #1). When ``DSPARK_ISSUE43_SCHED_DIAG=1`` is set in
   the container env, emit one compact line per scheduler step:
   ``[issue43-step N] running=K prefill_toks={..} decode_toks={..}
   decode_skips=[(rid,pos,computed)..]``. Off by default (zero overhead: the
   diag dict is cheap to build and only the log line is gated).

Idempotent. Anchors are asserted; re-applying is a no-op once all marks are
present. Safe to apply before or after the issue #27 hotfix (independent
regions).
