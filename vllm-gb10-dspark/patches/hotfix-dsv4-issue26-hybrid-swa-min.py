"""Issue #26 / #36 hybrid prefix-cache hotfix (v2).

DSV4-Flash + DSpark has four KV groups (1x MLA + 3x SlidingWindowMLA).
``find_longest_cache_hit`` takes the min hit length across groups.

v1 (issue #26) skipped that min for SlidingWindowSpec so a long MLA hit
survived when SWA only had a window tail. That restored warm x8 hit *rate*,
but when SWA did not actually have a tail at that length the engine still
skipped prefill and attached **null** SWA KV. Hermes-style shared ~21k
prefixes then decoded DSML / CJK salad (issue #36).

v2: SWA is allowed to shrink the common hit again. Warm long-prefix hits
come from ``VLLM_PREFIX_CACHE_RETENTION_INTERVAL`` (sparse SWA tails, default
4096), which keeps the last retained window instead of zeroing the hit.
A 21k prefix may cache ~20k instead of 21k; that is correct.

Idempotent. Reverts an in-image v1 inject. Called from the compose
entrypoint before ``exec vllm serve``.
